## 🧠 EDLines Study Project

This repository contains a comparative study and implementation of the **EDLines algorithm** for line segment detection in images.
It includes:

- A **custom implementation** in the root project (`EDStudy`).
- The **original EDLib** source code as a **git submodule** under `ED_Lib/`.

### 📁 Project Structure

```
.
├── ED_Lib/              # Original EDLines library (submodule)
├── images/              # Test images used for both implementations
├── CMakeLists.txt       # Build configuration for EDStudy
├── Makefile             # Unified Makefile (init, build, run)
├── test_ED.cpp          # Entry point for the custom EDLines test
└── README.md
```

---

### ⚙️ Requirements

- **CMake ≥ 3.11**
- **g++** or **clang** supporting C++11
- **OpenCV** installed and available in your system

On Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential cmake libopencv-dev
```

---

### 🚀 Quick Start

Clone the repository and initialize submodules:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/EDLINES-IMPLEMENTATION.git
cd EDLINES-IMPLEMENTATION
make init
```

---

### 🏗️ Build

To build both your implementation and the original EDLib:

```bash
make build
```

This will:

- Create `build/` for your project and compile it via CMake.
- Create `ED_Lib/build/` and compile the original EDLib project.

---

### ▶️ Run

To run **both** implementations on all images in the `images/` folder:

```bash
make run
```

To run only one version:

```bash
make run-main   # Run your version (root test_ED)
make run-edlib  # Run original version (ED_Lib/test_ED)
```

Each executable will be run for every image file found in the `images/` directory.

---

### 🧹 Clean and Rebuild

```bash
make clean     # Remove all build directories
make rebuild   # Clean and rebuild everything
```

---

### 🧩 Development Notes

- The main project uses CMake with debugging symbols enabled (`-g`).
- The `Makefile` provides a simplified workflow to compare results between your ED implementation and the original EDLib.
- To add new tests, simply place new image files in the `images/` folder.

### 📸 Example

```
make run
```

**Console output:**

```
🚀 Running test_ED from main project...
▶️ Running with images/example1.jpg
▶️ Running with images/example2.jpg

🚀 Running test_ED from ED_Lib submodule...
▶️ Running with images/example1.jpg
▶️ Running with images/example2.jpg
```
