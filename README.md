# EDLines Study Project

This project compares two **EDLines implementations**:
- Custom version in the root folder (`edlines-implementation`)
- Original EDLib as a **git submodule** in `ED_Lib/`

We refactored the Edge Detector and Lines Detector scripts in Cihan Topal and al repository (https://github.com/CihanTopal/ED_Lib) for explanatory and clarity purposes.
